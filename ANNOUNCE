WARNING: The output is not backward compatible.  See usage.
Options -a -e -i -p and plug.sh added.

Look into the source or experiment to see what can be done.
This is probably still far from ready yet.

Example to see everything:

udevraw -e '*'

Example to monitor for device change events:

udevraw -a change -f block -d disk

Sadly udevraw does not work properly on memory cards.
I do not get any event when I plug in a card.
The kernel only detects changes when I access the card.

As a workaround, see plug.sh

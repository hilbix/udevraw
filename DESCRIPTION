udevraw allows you to process udev events from shell.
In contrast to "udevadm monitor" it is designed to
be used directly from quick-and-dirty bash scripts.

Udev is not able to detect the change of a medium until
that medium is accessed.  It is able to see USB plug events
of card readers, but not of the memory card in the reader.
If you want to actively poll for a card change, see the
"plug.sh" example script how to do that.
